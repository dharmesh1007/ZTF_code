UGSS (U Geminorum)

- outbursts as in ZTF18abdgqzr are close together with average duration of 10 days, some of these are well sampled, others are not. Therefore it is easy to mistake multiple poorly sampled outbursts as a single long outburst. Furthermore, the sampling from one outbursts to another is inconsistent, therefore, it may appear as though some outbursts are of higher amplitude than others.

- On certain nights, ZTF18abmrusw contains multiple observations in a given band. The scatter in these measurements can be as much a 0.7 magnitudes forcing the observer to question whether the progression of the datapoints is real or just scatter, some may appear as outbursts, though it is difficult to ascertain if they are genuine. This object has very frequent outbursts, recurrence times of a few days only.

- For frequently outbursting systems, the quiescent level is difficult to locate, most of the observations have been acquired during outburst.

- ZTF18abobptn is an instance of a source where the Lasair and Alerce light curves for apparent magnitude differ. In Lasair, the light curve appears to be that of an SU Uma, while in Alerce it just appears as a U Gem. Same with ZTF18abmfybu for a particular datapoint.

- question: should I include sources that have only been observed for a short timespan. If they are sampled well enough to make out a feature (say outburst) then yes. Distinguishing these occurrences from similar ones displayed by other types may come down to colour or maximum brightness.

- Sources like ZTF18aceysta can make it difficult to distinguish between dwarf nova displaying subclasses, though again colour may play its part as metadata.

- Poorly sampled outbursts may appear as constant brightness, see ZTF19aagzlnb.

- ZTF18abyxsqb could be an example of a source displaying a slow rising dwarf nova outburst (a long outburst) possible confused with superoutbursts.

- ZTF18adkpgdq appears to display just the rise of several outbursts.

 - ZTF18aayhtdm looks more like a nova-like, no clear outbursts. Lasair light curve shows a couple of possible outbursts but these are not displayed in the Alerce light curves. EY Cygni was first detected with ROSAT X-ray obser- vatory in the energy range of 0.4‚Äì2.2 keV (Orio and Ogel- man, 1992). It is a U Gem type star with an orbital pe- riod of 11.0237976 h derived from absorption line analysis where the ephemeris was ùëá0 = 2449255.3260(9) (Echevar- riÃÅa et al., 2007). The physical parameters of the system are summarized in the Table 1. The visual magnitudes of the system during quiescence and outburst are ‚àº14.8 and ‚àº11, respectively (EchevarriÃÅa et al., 2007). The analysis of long term AAVSO light curves revealed that the recurrence time of the outbursts in the system is about 2000 days (Tovmas- sian et al., 2002) which is 8 times longer than the previously measured cycle by Piening (1978).

- ZTF18aazvhdb is an example of a U Gem system displaying rapid fire outbursts characteristic of a high mass transfer rate, long period system such as Z Cam, the possible confusion between these classes would be expected.

- ZTF18aasncio is a source that undergoes what appears to be a change in mass transfer rate

- Lasair apparent and difference magnitudes are different to Alerce for ZTF18abtjfvs.

- I am unsure of  V1449 Cyg aka ZTF18aawvssu, looks very stochastic so I'll leave this one out.

- ZTF18aakapxk, here sometimes just the peak and quiescence are sampled.

- ZTF18acyuqzg is a very bright source 14th mag undergoing several outbursts, the ASASYN light curve is clear, ZTF one is a little confusing.

- ZTF18aanvvqw reclassified as a Z Cam based on occurrences of obvious standstills.

- ZTF18aalapyu, will not be included even though it seems to be clear in https://sites.google.com/view/mgab-astronomy/mgab-v351-v400. I need to investigate why.


UGWZ (WZ Sge)

- Many light curves with one well sample long outburst.
- several with high amplitude which is a good indicator, though others do not display this.
- outbursts on a fading tail of a long outburst
- ZTF18aajpbxv is a blue object, these systems are very short period, so including this even though no outburst present, there are also lots of data points.

UGER (ER UMa)

- frequently outbursting systems and are redder than the WZ Sge, see ZTF18aawzsdg
- these should be superoutbursting though difficult to spot
- ZTF17aadkfiq show outbursts very poorly sampled though frequent, can be confusing
- ZTF18aaynvde is interesting, faint source with outbursts just about identifiable, red source.
- ZTF18aazetql faint but shows outbursts only in g band.

UGSS (U Gem)
- rapidly outbursting and not so rapidly outbursting system examples are ZTF18aazvhdb and ZTF18abcnbki
- These systems seem to be fairly red
- Not sure what is going on with ZTF18abcoxou, can just about make out outbursts, but very poorly sampled outbursts and well sampled quiescence.
- ZTF18aasncio is an incredibly interesting system, undergoing a mass transfer rate change during the last 400 days of the light curve, and displaying what appear to be eclipses. The outbursts themselves don't appear to be of uniform amplitude, though their durations are approximately the same.
- ZTF18abmszln does not appear to be so well sampled, though you can make out the outbursts.
- ZTF18aawvssu looks very stochastic, will remove.
- ZTF18aayotjv and ZTF18aawbmgc display standstills, these have been relabelled as Z_Cam

Nova-like:
- ZTF18abmnwwz seems like a regular NL but displays an unusual drop and recovery in brightness of amplitude 0.4 mags.

- ZTF18acxhody seems like an outbursting system

- Decided to treat obvious eclipses as a separate class identifiable through obvious eclipse label.

- regular nova-likes or nova remnants will be almost constant in brightness, no light curve variations above 1 magnitude, all others will be considered VY Scl.

- ZTF18aaadsvx is an obvious eclipser, but the light curve displays almost constant brightness, with modulations (long terms) of < 0.4 mags, while ZTF17aaawwxl shows a constant brightness, then in the latter half of the light curve, displays a shift to a lower state of brightness that is only 0.2 mags fainter - still regarding as a nova-like regular.

- ZTF18abmnwwz has some well sampled regions showing clear changes in brightness, though less than 0.5 magnitudes.

- ZTF18acxhody looks like it is outbursting, labelled as unclear.

- ZTF18abctcom looks like a borderline VY Scl according to our criteria, also looks like there are a couple of short amplitude outbursts in there too.

- Abrupt drops may be construed as outburst one they get back to high state, rise and decline times will be a factor here.

- ZTF18aabhuyb, ZTF18aaacgnn, ZTF18aceihyy, ZTF17aaawguy could be eclipsing nova-likes

- ZTF18abblvfk seems to undergo a low state where outbursts then occur, cool.

- ZTF18abskcci is a really interesting object, displaying 4 brightening events, the first and second last 80, with the former of a higher amplitude (0.6 mags), the next two have successively shorter durations and have smaller amplitudes. After each brightening event there is a dip in the brightness below the almost constant brightness that links them. The time between the first and second brightening is longest ~500 days, while the time between the second and third is shortest at ~150-200 days. I will leave it as a nova-like. ZTF18acewquy is another example.

- Poorly sampled nova-likes can pose an issue to distinguish between outbursting systems, e.g., ZTF18adbcyjj, ZTF19acbvswp

 - ZTF18absaltc eclipsing VY Scl

VY Scl:

 - ZTF19acarstz does not display VY Scl-iness

- ZTF18acawffe objects like that make classification difficult

- ZTF19aalcqff eclipsing nova-like?

- ZTF18aabtynl outbursting nova-like?

- ZTF21abjyptp nova-like that is kind of on the cusp of being a Z Cam

- completed VY Scl labelling

U_Gem (could be any dwarf nova type)

- just playing

- should focus on novae and magnetic CVs.
