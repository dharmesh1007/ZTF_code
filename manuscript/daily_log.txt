Had a scan through light curves of SU Uma type systems. Specifically those that are not sub labelled as AM Cvns, or DQ Her systems.

For a phenomenological classifier I have labelled these under several heading: outbursting, bimodal, stochastic, â€¦ mass transfer changes, clarity, most detailed classification. This information is contained in a manual_labelled file.

UGSS (U Gem) labels have been done.
Changed the apparent magnitude conversion to that of Alerce for Lasair light curves, yes!!! The details can be found via the pipeline link of Alerce.

Done some nova-like labelling.
