29th March 2023:

Had a scan through light curves of SU Uma type systems. Specifically those that are not sub labelled as AM Cvns, or DQ Her systems.

For a phenomenological classifier I have labelled these under several heading: outbursting, bimodal, stochastic, â€¦ mass transfer changes, clarity, most detailed classification. This information is contained in a manual_labelled file.

30th March 2023:

Started documenting this work in this file.
Personal access token for git: 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

7th April 2023:

UGSS (U Gem) labels have been done.
Changed the apparent magnitude conversion to that of Alerce for Lasair light curves, yes!!! The details can be found via the pipeline link of Alerce.

12th April 2023:
Done some nova-like labelling.

13th April 2023:

Completed nova-like and VY Scl labelling

Added a few subclasses from the U_Gem (could be any dwarf nova subtype) list.

Need to focus on magnetic CVs and novae now.

14th April 2023:

- Labelled novae and AM Hers.

- DQ Hers now

15th April 2023:

- Completed all labelling apart from CV, CV+E, UG, and UG+E.
- Should consider looking through the eclipsers and guessing or training a classifier on the existing classified sources and classifier the remainder.

22nd April 2023:

- Placed standstill and peak calculators into functions and then into the feature extractor module, which has now been generated in this git tracked folder.

- The module is now in the form of a class.

- Need to formulate a colour feature and the get the period finder ratio thing.

23rd April 2023:

- Completed the construction of light curve based features and placed them into the module.
- The module works fine now.
- Next step would be to incorporate metadata based features.
