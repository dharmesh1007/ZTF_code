IMPORTANT STUFF:

Use:

GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git push origin main

If Git push origin main does not work.


29th March 2023:

Had a scan through light curves of SU Uma type systems. Specifically those that are not sub labelled as AM Cvns, or DQ Her systems.

For a phenomenological classifier I have labelled these under several heading: outbursting, bimodal, stochastic, â€¦ mass transfer changes, clarity, most detailed classification. This information is contained in a manual_labelled file.

30th March 2023:

Started documenting this work in this file.
Personal access token for git: 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

7th April 2023:

UGSS (U Gem) labels have been done.
Changed the apparent magnitude conversion to that of Alerce for Lasair light curves, yes!!! The details can be found via the pipeline link of Alerce.

12th April 2023:
Done some nova-like labelling.

13th April 2023:

Completed nova-like and VY Scl labelling

Added a few subclasses from the U_Gem (could be any dwarf nova subtype) list.

Need to focus on magnetic CVs and novae now.

14th April 2023:

- Labelled novae and AM Hers.

- DQ Hers now

15th April 2023:

- Completed all labelling apart from CV, CV+E, UG, and UG+E.
- Should consider looking through the eclipsers and guessing or training a classifier on the existing classified sources and classifier the remainder.

22nd April 2023:

- Placed standstill and peak calculators into functions and then into the feature extractor module, which has now been generated in this git tracked folder.

- The module is now in the form of a class.

- Need to formulate a colour feature and the get the period finder ratio thing.

23rd April 2023:

- Completed the construction of light curve based features and placed them into the module.
- The module works fine now.
- Next step would be to incorporate metadata based features.

23rd May 2023:

- Formulation of a feature extraction routine based on existing algorithm
- identify features to extract
- identify processing mechanism
- set up function  


17th August 2023:

- Attempted using a multihead CNN with linearly interpolated magnitudes, a head for each band since the times are not aligned. Also added colour that is also linearly interpolated. I did not backfill these and just interpolated and divided by 1000 points.

- Now attempting to use histograms of the magnitudes, magnitude derivatives using only the peaks and troughs, and the same with all data points.

- Experiment 1: magnitude changes dm, with all data points.

 - ks=5, l2=0.015, g_dmhist_100_10_ks5, Confusion between the SU Uma and AM CVn classes is rather large, it depends upon the weights initialisation.
 - ks=10 produces slightly better results for the SU Uma class.
 - ks=15 unsure whether this adds any more value
 - ks=20 again a little unsure, although the accuracy may be a little higher

- Experiment 2: magnitude changes dm, with just peaks and troughs

 - ks=5, Crappy score and noisy learning
 - ks=10 Seems a little better, especially with Z Cam (compared to when using all the data points)
 - ks=15
 - ks=20 Seems to do better with a larger kernel size

- Experiment 3: dmdt with all data points,

 - ks=5  Does well with SU Uma though still dependent on the initialisation
 - ks=10 Not sure it makes a huge difference but it is identifying some patterns.
 - ks=15 The performance improves slightly as we increase the kernel size.
 - ks=20 As we increase the size of the kernels the classification of the non - DNe suffer.
 - ks=100 As we increase the kernel size to the maximum the performance of the model tends towards favouring the correct classification of SU Uma to the detriment of other classes.

- Experiment 4: dmdt with just peaks and troughs

 - ks=5  SU UMa classification spread out; others also spread out a little but not too much
 - ks=10 
 - ks=15 SU Uma classification improves with increasing the kernel size
 - ks=20 Volatile validation accuracy during training.
 - ks=25 Similar to above

- Experiments show to varying the kernel size has an affect on the classes of data that are correctly classified.
- I am feeling like a complete piece of shit right now.
- This day sucks so badly, I am just struggling with this crap.
- I know I need to suffer a little today
