Feature testing notes

Standstill finder:
-Clear standstills around 25 and above for ratio of max/min std, though frequently eclipsing nova-likes; frequently sampled quiescent stages in U Gem and SU Uma light curve; light curves with just one well sampled outburst; and some VY Scl types tend to have high values of this too.
- The above issues may be handled when combined with the standstill level which described how bright the standstill is.
- Another way of handling confusion is the light curve periodicity along with its power ratio.

G-r colour epochal features:
- introduced the standard deviation of the epochal colour as well as the mean and median.
- if there is not enough information for epochal colour we just used the average of the whole light curve, not just the matched epochs
- included the colour at brightest and faintest epoch.
- for insufficient epoch cases, we relaxed the same epoch constraint.

Period fitting:
- used the ratio of max to mean power to identify significant signals.

Now require metadata based features.
